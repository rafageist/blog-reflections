# Reflections

A versioned collection of personal reflections on time, logic, systems, information, and the boundaries of thought.

This repository powers an open notebook — a writing lab where ideas are shaped, tested, and rewritten.  
It is built for slow thinking, recursive insight, and public traceability.

## 📖 What is this?

This is not a traditional blog. There is no linear feed, no fixed audience, no trending topics.

It is a **versioned, non-linear notebook**. Each entry is a snapshot of reasoning, often philosophical, sometimes technical, always unfinished.

The central content lives in the **[Wiki](../../wiki)**, where each page functions as a standalone reflection.  
Ideas evolve across time, edits are tracked, and previous thoughts are not erased — they are archived.

## 🧠 Why version a blog?

Writing is thinking. Ideas change. Beliefs break and reform.  
This repository provides:

- A full history of every change and rewrite (via Git).
- A structure for branching thoughts, dead ends, and alternative views.
- A stable archive of intellectual evolution over time.

## 📚 Topics explored

- The illusion of time travel  
- Information as the substance of causality  
- Infinities, recursion, and paradox  
- Consciousness and computation  
- Language and the boundaries of meaning  
- The epistemology of software  
- The limits of machines and minds  

## 🖨️ Read as book

All wiki entries are periodically compiled into PDF booklets.  
These releases serve as printable or downloadable editions of the reflections.
