# Reflections

A versioned collection of personal reflections on time, logic, systems, information, and the boundaries of thought.  
This repository hosts the **Wiki** that serves as my open writing lab, and a GitHub Actions pipeline to produce PDF booklets from it.

## What is this?

This is not a blog in the traditional sense.  
It is a **versioned, evolving notebook** ‚Äî where ideas mature through writing and rewriting.  
You‚Äôre invited to read, question, reuse, or build upon what's here.

## Structure

-  **Wiki**: All content lives in the [Wiki](../../wiki) ‚Äî each page is a standalone entry or chapter.
-  **GitHub Actions**: Periodically builds the entire Wiki into a formatted PDF release.
-  **Releases**: See [Releases](../../releases) for downloadable snapshots in PDF format.
-  **LICENSE**: Content is shared under Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0.

## Why version a blog?

Ideas evolve.  
Writing is thinking.  
This repository:
- Preserves each version of a reflection (via Git).
- Allows branching and refinement without fear.
- Offers a growing, open trace of intellectual development.

## üìö Topics I explore

- The illusion of time travel  
- The role of information in causality  
- Infinities, recursion, and system limits  
- Language as interface to existence  
- Computation as epistemology  
- False problems and how to detect them  

## üñ®Ô∏è Download as book

Compiled releases are available as PDF snapshots of the Wiki.  
You can read it like a book, cite it, or share it.
