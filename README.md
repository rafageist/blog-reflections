# Reflections

A versioned collection of personal reflections on diverse topics: time, logic, systems, information, language, technology, and the limits of thought.

This repository is not a blog in the usual sense. It is an open notebook — a writing lab where ideas are shaped, tested, revised, and reinterpreted.  
The goal is not to reach final answers, but to preserve the history of questions and the evolution of reasoning.

## What is this?

- No linear feed.  
- No fixed audience.  
- No trending topics.  

It is a **non-linear, versioned notebook**.  
Each entry is a snapshot of reasoning — sometimes philosophical, sometimes technical, always provisional.  

The central content lives in the **[Wiki](../../wiki)**, where each page functions as a standalone reflection.  
Ideas evolve across time, edits are tracked, and previous thoughts are not erased — they remain as part of the record.

## Why version reflections?

Writing is a process of thinking. Ideas change. Beliefs fracture and reform.  
This repository provides:

- A full history of changes and rewrites (via Git).  
- A structure for branching thoughts, counterpoints, and alternative lines of reasoning.  
- A stable archive of intellectual evolution across time.  

## Topics explored

The reflections are deliberately diverse. Examples include:  

- The illusion of time travel and the logic of causality  
- Information as the fabric of reality  
- Infinities, recursion, and paradox  
- Consciousness and computation  
- Language and its boundaries  
- The epistemology of software  
- The limits of machines, systems, and minds  

## Read as book

All wiki entries are periodically compiled into PDF booklets.  
These releases serve as printable or downloadable editions of the reflections.
