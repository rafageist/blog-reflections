   Description:
     This Prolog knowledge base models the conceptual distinctions
     between learning, studying, understanding, educating,
     indoctrination, etc., as discussed in the blog article.
   ============================================================ */

/* ---------- Basic Concepts ---------- */

concept(learn).
concept(study).
concept(understand).
concept(memorize).
concept(educate).
concept(self_educate).
concept(indoctrinate).
concept(know).

/* Semantic roles */
result(learn).
result(know).

process(study).
process(memorize).
process(educate).
process(self_educate).
process(indoctrinate).

depth(understand).    % understanding adds depth/structure

/* Semantic properties */
implies_autonomy(learn).
implies_autonomy(self_educate).
may_imply_autonomy(educate).

aims_to_think(educate).
aims_to_obey(indoctrinate).

/* ---------- Core Relations ---------- */

/* 1) Studying is (potentially) a means to learning */
means_to(study, learn).

/* 2) Memorizing is a sub-process inside studying */
subprocess(memorize, study).

/* 3) Learning and studying are not opposites, nor equivalent */
not_equivalent(learn, study).
not_opposite(learn, study).

/* 4) Understanding is not identical to learning, but enhances it */
not_equivalent(understand, learn).
enhances(understand, learn).

/* 5) Educating is not indoctrinating */
not_equivalent(educate, indoctrinate).
mutually_exclusive_intention(educate, indoctrinate).

/* 6) Educating and self-educating complement each other */
complementary(educate, self_educate).

/* 7) Knowing is a posterior state */
posterior_to(know, learn).
posterior_to(know, understand).
posterior_to(know, study).     % if study led to real learning
posterior_to(know, educate).   % if education was genuine

/* ---------- Inference Rules ---------- */

/* Studying leads to learning if it’s not reduced to obedience,
   and includes deeper components like understanding or practice. */
leads_to_learning(study) :-
    \+ reduces_to(study, obedience),
    ( includes(study, understand)
    ; includes(study, meaningful_practice)
    ; includes(study, critical_dialogue)
    ).

/* Memorizing alone does not guarantee learning */
leads_to_learning(memorize) :-
    includes(memorize, understand) ; includes(memorize, transfer),
    !.
leads_to_learning(memorize) :- fail.

/* Indoctrination never educates in the strong sense */
educates_in_strong_sense(X) :-
    process(X),
    aims_to_think(X),
    \+ aims_to_obey(X).

does_not_educate_in_strong_sense(indoctrinate).

/* Learning can happen without formal study */
possible_without_formal_study(learn).

/* Studying may occur without producing real learning */
possible_without_learning(study).

/* Understanding increases transferability of knowledge */
increases_transferability(understand).

/* ---------- Auxiliary Facts ---------- */

/* Bad practice: studying reduced to obedience */
reduces_to(study, obedience) :-
    includes(study, mechanical_memorization),
    \+ includes(study, understand).

/* Good study practices */
includes(study, understand).
includes(study, meaningful_practice).
includes(study, critical_dialogue).

/* Memorizing with value (if integrated) — off by default */
includes(memorize, understand) :- fail.
includes(memorize, transfer) :- fail.

/* ---------- Query Helpers ---------- */

/* X is a means, Y is a goal/result */
is_means_and_end(X,Y) :- means_to(X,Y), result(Y).

/* Wrong opposition if concepts are neither equivalent nor opposites */
false_opposition(X,Y) :-
    concept(X), concept(Y),
    not_equivalent(X,Y),
    not_opposite(X,Y).

/* Ideal educational system (abstract model):
   - Guides by educating
   - Avoids indoctrination
   - Recognizes studying as a means */
ideal_education_system(System) :-
    System = system(guides:educate, avoids:indoctrinate, recognizes:study_as_means),
    educates_in_strong_sense(educate),
    \+ does_not_educate_in_strong_sense(educate),
    means_to(study, learn).

/* ---------- Example Queries ----------

true.

?- subprocess(memorize, study).
true.

?- false_opposition(learn, study).
true.

?- leads_to_learning(study).
true.   % because includes understanding etc.

?- leads_to_learning(memorize).
false.  % unless explicitly enriched

?- not_equivalent(educate, indoctrinate).
true.

?- educates_in_strong_sense(indoctrinate).
false.

?- possible_without_formal_study(learn).
true.

?- possible_without_learning(study).
true.

?- increases_transferability(understand).
true.

?- ideal_education_system(S).
S = system(guides:educate, avoids:indoctrinate, recognizes:study_as_means).
